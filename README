Here is an implementation of the classic reversi game.
Features include: 3D animation, game state in URL, multiplayer and original AI.
To see it in action visit:

http://reversi3d.appspot.com

Client is written in js and uses webgl (with fallback to simple canvas) through three.js 3D library.
Server is java servlet intended to be deployed to GAE.
Local GAE server and ant were used for development.
However game can partly function without server side.
Game was tested with firefox and chrome on linux.
Resources (sound, background) was not authored by me.
Links to their original sources are mentioned inside the game.
AI implementation was written by me earlier for another implementation.
